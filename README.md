# Multi-agent System with Artificial Intelligence

This is the program that simulates a crowd for my final project at Bournemouth University.

In this project, an A* pathfinding algorithm has been used to calculate shortest route for each agent between given starting and end positions by avoiding the obstacles within the scene. Furthermore, a collision detection algorithm has been applied to individuals to avoid collision with agents each other. Application has been written by using C++ and OpenGL.

The program draws a maze as default and places the agents at the entrances of the maze as their start position and assigns their end positions on the other side of the maze to give them a target to reach.
