# Crowd Simulation

This is a program that simulates a crowd for an MSc simulation assignments project.

Code available on GitHub.

# User Interaction

This work allows user to get interact with the system via keyboard. The simulation starts
with creating agents into the system with random directions and speeds. From this moment,
agents keep moving randomly until the user press one of the command keys given below.

Key S: Stop. Freeze the entire system to observe positions of agents in the system.

Key R: Random motion. Let agents move randomly around the system as it was in the
beginning.

Key C: Crowd motion. Directs agents through the mass centre to form the crowd.

Arrows: After turned to crowd motion by pressing Key C, user can relocate the mass centre
to move the crowd around the system.
